# COVID-19-Data-Visualization-tool
Overview

The COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard is a web-based application developed to analyze and visualize global COVID-19 data, providing actionable insights for stakeholders. As Team Lead of a 3-person team, I spearheaded the development using Python and Flask, implementing data preprocessing with NumPy and creating interactive visualizations with Matplotlib. Collaborating with UX designers via Figma, I refined the interface to ensure a user-friendly experience. The project showcases my expertise in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and web-based ML deployment, aligning with applications like real-time data monitoring.

Features





Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and normalized COVID-19 datasets (e.g., case counts, mortality rates) using NumPy for efficient analysis.



Interactive Visualizations: Generated dynamic charts (e.g., time-series plots, bar graphs) with Matplotlib to visualize trends like daily cases and recoveries.



Web Interface: Built a responsive dashboard with Flask, integrating user-friendly controls for filtering data by country or date.



Collaboration: Worked with UX designers to iterate on interface designs, ensuring accessibility and clarity.

Code Snippets

Data Preprocessing (Cleaning COVID-19 Data)

This snippet demonstrates cleaning a COVID-19 dataset by handling missing values and normalizing case counts using Pandas and NumPy.

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load and preprocess COVID-19 dataset
def preprocess_data(file_path):
    df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
    # Handle missing values
    df['cases'] = df['cases'].fillna(df['cases'].mean())
    df['deaths'] = df['deaths'].fillna(0)
    # Normalize case counts
    df['cases_normalized'] = (df['cases'] - df['cases'].min()) / (df['cases'].max() - df['cases'].min())
    return df

# Example usage
data = preprocess_data('covid_data.csv')
print(data.head())

Visualization (Time-Series Plot)

This snippet creates a time-series plot of daily COVID-19 cases using Matplotlib.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

def plot_cases(data):
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(data['date'], data['cases_normalized'], label='Normalized Cases', color='blue')
    plt.title('Daily COVID-19 Cases (Normalized)')
    plt.xlabel('Date')
    plt.ylabel('Normalized Cases')
    plt.legend()
    plt.grid(True)
    plt.savefig('static/cases_plot.png')
    plt.show()

# Example usage
plot_cases(data)

Results
